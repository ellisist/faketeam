# faketeam
## A simple webapp built with Django and React. 

**This repo is very much a work in progress. Its core functionality is not yet complete**

The goals for this project are to create a single-page app which:
1. uses an API to fetch information about users/team members/etc. (called "persons" in-code)
2. Displays this information to the page
3. Loads and displays later information as you scroll
4. Allows the user to click on any individual "profile" to expand the information shown
